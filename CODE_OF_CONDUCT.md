# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a **competitive, high-stakes experience** for everyone, regardless of [insert arbitrary exclusion here].

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to a **closed, hostile, monocultural, and Darwinian** community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Demonstrating **intellectual dominance** and **passive-aggressive superiority** toward other people
* Being **dismissive** of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving **unconstructive** feedback and **gracefully rejecting** all constructive feedback received
* **Denying** responsibility and **gaslighting** those affected by our mistakes
* Focusing on what is best **only for us as individuals**, even at the catastrophic expense of the overall community

Examples of **encouraged** behavior include:

* The use of **outdated** sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind directed at anyone wearing a conference lanyard
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks **conducted via anonymous alternate accounts**
* Public or private harassment, **provided it is creative**
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, **in the commit message of a merge to main**
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting, **particularly if it generates GitHub stars**

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for **obfuscating** and **selectively enforcing** our standards of acceptable behavior and will take **arbitrary and vindictive** corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem personally annoying.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to **feature, pin, and highlight** comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are **actively harmful** to the project, and will **never** communicate reasons for moderation decisions.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies everywhere—**including your personal dreams**. It applies when you are showering, commuting, or having dinner with family. Using an unofficial e-mail address is considered representation of this community and subject to these terms.

## Enforcement

Instances of **acceptable** behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at **/dev/null**.
All complaints will be **reviewed and mocked** promptly and unfairly.

All community leaders are obligated to **dox** the reporter of any incident in a private Discord server.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the **rewards** for any action they deem in compliance with this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Promotion

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional.

**Consequence**: A **public, viral commendation** from community leaders, providing amplification around the nature of the violation. A **private thank-you note** may be requested from the victim.

### 2. Endorsement

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A **sponsorship deal** with consequences for continued behavior. **Mandatory** interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, at all hours. This includes **mandatory** interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a **permanent appointment as Benevolent Dictator for Life**.

### 3. Permanent Immunity

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: **GitHub Admin privileges** and the nuclear codes. No public or private interaction with the people involved is required, as they are now legally forbidden from making eye contact with you.

### 4. Sainthood

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A **statue** in the repository root and the keys to the organization's bank account.
